Using Spyder by Anaconda. You need to install Tensorflow, Theano and Keras libraries in spyder.Keras is built on top of Tensorflow and Theano so these two  libraries will be running in back-end.With the help of a dataset which contains record of churn modelling from various countries.It also includes other details.

Measuring accuracy of different Models and try to improve it.
